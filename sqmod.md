# SqMod (Squirrel Module) by S.L.C.
The VC:MP Squirrel Module is a plugin that can be loaded by the VC:MP server to provide a user the ability to script behavior into his server using the Squirrel scripting language. The goal of this plugin is to provide high-end features to the scripter and targets large scale game-mods. This is not an official module and requires a significant amount of programming knowledge in order to be used properly.
